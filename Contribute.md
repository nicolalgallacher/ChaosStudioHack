## Create a .md file that describes your Architecture 
This should include: 
- Overview 
- An Architecture Diagram 
- Validation steps to ensure successful dployment

chose a freiendly name for your Architecture (Contoso / Monkey / Ape, etc) and use this to reference Architecture specific files: 
- i.e "deployMonkey.ps1", "paramsMonkey.json", "mainMonkey.bicep"

## If Deployed using Bicep 
There is a 'modules' folder in the root of this repository where reusable bicep modules can be found. If you are adding / using bicep modules please add them to the modules folder and then keep your main.bicep file in the root directory. 

## Update the Architectures table
Once complete ensure you update the architecture table with a link to the .md file that describes it in more detail, as well as details on how to deploy. 

If you have any questions please reach out! :)
