# Chaos Studio Hack

## Overview

Welcome to this Chaos Studio Hack, where we will allow you to deploy Chaos Experiments on pre-built architectures!

We will be following the iterative process below as the base for the activities we will be carrying out:

## Hack Architectures

Please select a base architecture example you would like to work with from the descriptions below: 

| Name     | Despriction                                          | Deploy                              |     
| -------- | -----------------------------------------------------| ------------------------------------|
| Monkey   | IIS Web Servers with Public Load Balancer Front End  |  Run 'deployMonkey.ps1' to deploy in your subscription                                |
| More Comming Soon!

## Hypothesize
What outages can you think have that may effect this architecture? 
How do you think the current architecture would handle a High Availability outage?
## Experiment  
Break the system! :D 
## Analyze
Did the architecture handle the outage in the way you thought? 
Was there a full outage or was the architecture able to stay running? 
## Improve 
How would you improve the architecture based on your experiment results?
