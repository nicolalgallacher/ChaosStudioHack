## Hypothesize
What outages can you think have that may effect this architecture? 
How do you think the current architecture would handle a High Availability outage?
## Experiment  
Break the system! :D 
## Analyze
Did the architecture handle the outage in the way you thought? 
Was there a full outage or was the architecture able to stay running? 
## Improve 
How would you improve the architecture based on your experiment results?
